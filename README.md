Existing System:
Generally feedback is collected from students in order to get a complete review of faculties and asses the quality and teaching standards of each faculty. This feedback collection is done in every semester and for all branches. This helps the college management to manage and maintain the teaching standards. Feedback is collected from the students in the form of a sheet called feedback form. This feedback form consists of around 10 questions and students need to rate them on the scale of 1 to 5. This involves collecting thousands of sheets of feedback forms and manually entering the same data digitally in excel sheets. 

Limitations of The Existing System:

A common problem faced by the department is that when a particular student is absent they miss out to record his/her feedback .As feedback of each and every student is important and play’s a significant role in improving the teaching standards it may lead to improper results if not considered.
Conducting survey’s in classroom may result in biased feedbacks as students generally share their opinions and discuss with each other. 

Our Solution:

Developing a user friendly application which consists of an interface which prompts the user to enter his/her details and get registered into the database, further allowing the students to take the surveys according to their respective year and branch. Once the student is done with the survey, all the details along with the credentials of the student gets stored in the database which the admin can access.
